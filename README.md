# User Microservice

This is one of the microservice that I will be using for my other frontend chat POC project. This is using NestJS framework and Sequelize library

### Setup

- Install all dependencies using `npm install`
- Create a copy of environment file by running `cp .env.template .env` and set up accordingly
- Run command `docker compose up -d` to initialize database locally
- Start the application using the command `npm start`
- To run in dev mode, you may use the command `npm run start:dev`
